# Neural-Information-Processing-
Projects and simulations exploring computational models of the brain and neural information processing.
This repository collects projects and experiments related to Neural Information Processing (NIP).  
It covers topics in computational neuroscience, neural modeling, synaptic dynamics, learning rules, and spike-based information coding.

Each project explores a specific concept or model â€” from classical neuron models like Hodgkin-Huxley to modern learning-based systems.

Stay tuned as the repository grows with new simulations, analyses, and insights from the field of neural computation.
